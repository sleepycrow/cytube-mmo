# CyTube MMO (reborn)

A customizable, proof-of-concept multiplayer game that uses the CyTube chatroom to communicate between players. Allows room admins to set their own selection of rooms and player skins.
Based on the code of [offl1n3](https://github.com/sleepycrow/offl1n3).

## Testing and Building

To test, simply run `npm run build-dev`. This will build a dev build of the game, then start a web and websockets server on port 10001.

To make a release build, simply run `npm run build-prod`. The finished file will be located in `dist/js/`.
